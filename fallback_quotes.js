It kind of explained why people liked to share what they want to do so much on social media, and how maybe that is discouraging us from actually following through on our plans a lot of times, whether it's a New Year's resolution, or the kind of art you want to make, or even for non-artists, just other plans ... I think putting action behind our plans is most important.",
